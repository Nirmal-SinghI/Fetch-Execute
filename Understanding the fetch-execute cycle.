The fetch decode execute cycle is the basic foundational unit of a computer, almost of all computers.
At some instance we could basically take these machines as some overgrown calculators who calculate all the 
instructions provided by the user and put it into play. 

Various compoents come into play to make these things work.

                  | Program   |          | ALU     |  | IR   |
                  | Counter   |          | (ACC)   |  |      |
                  +-----------+          +---------+  +------+

The above given diagram is a basic view of the large bulky calculations that make the computer 
function as it should.
