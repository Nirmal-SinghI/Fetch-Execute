# Arithmetic and logic unit(ALU):

One of the main goals and purpose of a computer is to perform compuatation which requires manipulating and performing tasks on 
numbers, that what ALU does. The ALU is the brain of a computer in literal meaning.Mainly ALU is dividid into 2 parts arithmetic 
unit and the logic unit, where both carry out different tasks as per their name.

# Arithmetic Unit:
It is responsible for handling mostly all the numerical operations inside of a computer like additiona and subtraction.
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a crucial component of a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) that performs all arithmetic and logical operations.
It handles fundamental computations and decision-making tasks required for processing data.

Uses of ALU in Computers:
Arithmetic Operations – The ALU performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
which are essential for computations in software applications.

Logical Operations – It executes logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, which are used in decision-making, conditional execution,
and bitwise manipulations.

Comparison Operations – The ALU compares values (e.g., greater than, less than, equal to) and sets flags that help the system 
determine the next action, such as branching in programs.

Data Movement and Manipulation – It helps in shifting and rotating bits, which are useful for optimizing operations 
like encryption, compression, and graphics processing.

Address Calculations – In certain cases, the ALU helps compute memory addresses, especially in operations involving arrays and pointers.

Applications in Real Life:
Used in calculators for performing basic arithmetic.
Helps in gaming for processing in-game physics and logic.
Supports encryption and security algorithms through bitwise operations.
Powers scientific computations in engineering and data analysis software.
Overall, the ALU is the brain of computation inside a computer, enabling it to perform all fundamental processing tasks efficiently.
